Hello GitHub! 

My name's Josh and I'm an aspiring Programmer. Of what, you ask? ...Yes.

When the economy of your primary occupation collapses and your fallback job falls through, naturally attention swings back to aspirations you had 10+ years ago(and didn't focus on then) Well, time to reevaluate things.

The constant self doubt paired with a complex routlette-esque habit of switching intellectual gears ends here. This field has always appealed to me; the interest has always never wavered.

We'll see how far I go. 

Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.
